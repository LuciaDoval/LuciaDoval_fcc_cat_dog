# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This project is part of the [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) course by **freeCodeCamp**. The goal is to build a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow 2.0** and **Keras** that can classify images of cats and dogs with at least **63% accuracy**.

## 📌 Project Overview

I have build and trained a CNN that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a structured dataset. I have also implemented image preprocessing, data augmentation, training/validation logic, and final evaluation through predictions.

This project runs in **Google Colaboratory** and involves working directly with Python and TensorFlow code in an interactive notebook environment.

## 🧠 What I did

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cell #3 | Set up `ImageDataGenerator` for train, validation, and test data. |
| Cell #4 | Visualize sample training images. |
| Cell #5 | Recreate the training generator with **data augmentation** (4–6 transformations). |
| Cell #6 | Visualize augmented images. |
| Cell #7 | Build the CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers. |
| Cell #8 | Train the model using `model.fit()`. |
| Cell #9 | Plot training/validation accuracy and loss. |
| Cell #10 | Predict on the test images and visualize predictions. |
| Cell #11 | Evaluate your model accuracy (must be ≥ 63% to pass). |
